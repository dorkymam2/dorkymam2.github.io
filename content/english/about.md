<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Kevin!</h1>

<div align="center">
  <span style="color: grey;">I'm a junior at Sunny Hills High School and ever since partaking in Science Olympiad at my middle school, I've grown an interest in physics. Over the course of these years, I would spend my free time indulging in physics content on the internet. When I gained the necessary mathematical skill set, I started to study some of the topics that intrigued me. In particular, I spent my freshman and sophomore year learning classical mechanics and applying it to several aspects of my life. Last year, I was given the opportunity to take Sunny's AP Physics 1 class and, using some of my previous knowledge, was able to help classmates study for tests and quizzes. This process inspired me to put together some resources for our community, but I couldn't find the time to gather them into a cohesive whole. Therefore, I spent my summer creating Physics Lair. I hope that these handouts and problem sets can make navigating a challenging course that much easier for all of you! I hate this baka life. </span>
